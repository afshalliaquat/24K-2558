#### Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

ask user to enter a no a

ask user to enter another no b

ask user to enter an arithmetic operator + or - or * or / or %

check the arithmetic operator

     if arithmetic operator is + then 
         display sum = a + b
     if arithmetic operator is - then 
         display sub = a - b
     if arithmetic operator is * then 
         display multiplication = a * b
     if arithmetic operator is / then 
         if b is not equal to 0
            display division = a / b
         else
            display division is not possible
     if arithmetic operator is % then 
         if b is not equal to 0
            display modulo = a % b
         else
            display division is not possible
else 

     display "entered an invalid operator"
