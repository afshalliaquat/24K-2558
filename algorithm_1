Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Enter a no suppose N
enter another no suppose n
divide n by N 
check if remainder is 0 then 
  display N is the divisor of n
  check if last digit of the N is 2,4,6,8,0 then display N is even 
  else display N is odd
else 
    display N is not the divisor of n
